[Oratio]
Omnipotente y sempiterno Dios, que por medio de una abstinencia saludable curas las dolencias del cuerpo y del alma: rogamos humildemente a tu majestad que, aplacado con la piadosa suplica de los que ayunamos, nos concedas los auxilios presentes y venideros.

Lectura del libro del Levítico
!Lv. 23, 26-32
En aquel tiempo, habló el Señor a Moisés, y le dijo: El décimo día de este séptimo mes será el día solemnísimo de la Expiación o perdón y se llamará santo; y mortificaréis en él vuestras almas, y ofreceréis holocausto al Señor. En todo este día no haréis ninguna obra servil; porque es día de propiciación, a fin de que os sea propicio el Señor Dios vuestro. Cualquiera que en este día no hiciere penitencia, será exterminado de entre sus gentes, y yo raeré de la lista de su pueblo al que hiciere alguna labor. Por tanto, no trabajéis poco ni mucho en este día. Ley sempiterna será ésta para vosotros y para vuestros descendientes, en cualquier lugar en que moréis. Es fiesta o sábado de descanso, y desde el día nono del mes mortificaréis vuestras almas. Vuestras fiestas las celebraréis desde una tarde hasta la otra.

[GradualeL1]
!Sal 78, 9-10
Señor; perdónanos nuestros pecados; no sea que se diga ante los gentiles: ¿Dónde está el Dios de ésos?

Grant us, we beseech You, almighty God, that by fasting we may be filled with Your grace, and by abstinence we may be made stronger than all our enemies.

!Lv. 23, 39-43 
En aquel tiempo, dijo el Señor a Moisés: Desde el día quince, pues, del mes séptimo, cuando habréis ya recogido todos los frutos de vuestra tierra, celebraréis una fiesta al Señor por siete días. El día primero y el octavo serán como días de sábado, esto es, de descanso. En el primer día cogeréis ramas con sus frutos de los árboles más bellos, y gajos o ramos de palmas, y de árboles frondosos, y de sauces de los torrentes, y os regocijaréis delante del Señor Dios vuestro; y celebraréis cada año esta solemne fiesta por espacio de siete días; ley que será observada eternamente por toda vuestra descendencia. Celebraréis esta fiesta en el séptimo mes, y habitaréis por siete días en tiendas cubiertas de ramas: todo el que es del linaje de Israel estará en tiendas de campaña, para que aprendan vuestros descendientes cómo hice yo habitar en tiendas de campaña a los hijos de Israel al sacarlos de la tierra de Egipto. Yo el Señor Dios vuestro.

!Mich. 7:14, 16, 18-20.
O Lord, our God, shepherd Your people with Your staff, the flock of Your inheritance, that dwells in a woodland, as in the days of old. The nations shall behold and be put to shame, in spite of all their strength. Who is there like you, the God Who removes guilt and pardons sin for the remnant of His inheritance; Who does not persist in anger forever, but delights rather in clemency, and will again have compassion on us, treading underfoot our guilt? You will cast into the depths of the sea all our sins; You will show faithfulness to Jacob, and grace to Abraham, as You have sworn to our fathers from days of old, O Lord, our God.

!Zach. 8:14-19
In those days, the word of the Lord came to me saying: Thus says the Lord of Hosts: As I determined to harm you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath, says the Lord of Hosts, and I did not relent, so again in these days I have determined to favor Jerusalem and the house of Juda; do not fear! These then are the things you should do: Speak the truth to one another; let there be honesty and peace in the judgments at your gates, and let none of you plot evil against another in his heart, nor love a false oath. For all these things I hate, says the Lord. This word of the Lord of Hosts came to me: Thus says the Lord of Hosts: The fast days of the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, and the tenth months shall become occasions of joy and gladness, cheerful festivals for the house of Juda; only love faithfulness and peace, says the Lord of Hosts.

!Dan 3:47-51
In those day, the Angel of the Lord went down into the furnace with Azaria and his companions, drove the fiery flames out of the furnace, and made the inside of the furnace as though a dew-laden breeze were blowing through it. And the flames rose forty-nine cubits above the furnace, and spread out, burning the Chaldeans nearby, the king’s men who were stoking the furnace. And the fire in no way touched them or caused them pain or harm. Then these three in the furnace with one voice sang, glorifying and blessing God:

Blessed are You upon the sceptre of Your divinity, praiseworthy and exalted above all forever. Blessed are You Who look into the depths from Your throne upon the Cherubim, praiseworthy and exalted above all forever. Blessed are You Who walk upon the wings of the wind, and on the waves of the sea, praiseworthy and exalted above all forever. Let all Your Angels and Saints bless You, and praise You and exalt You above all forever. Let the heavens, the earth, the sea and all the things that are in them bless You, and praise You and exalt You above all forever. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, praiseworthy and exalted above all forever. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

Lesson
!Heb 9:2-12
Brethren: There was set up a tabernacle in the outer part of which were the lampstand and the table and the showbread, and this is called the Holy Place; but beyond the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies, having a golden censer and the ark of the covenant, overlaid on every side with gold. In the ark was a golden pot containing the manna and the rod of Aaron which had budded, and the tablets of the covenant; and above it were the Cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat. But of all these we cannot now speak in detail. Such then being the arrangements, the priests always used to enter into the first tabernacle to perform the sacred rites; but into the second tabernacle the high priest alone entered once a year, not without blood, which he offered for his own and the people’s sins of ignorance. The Holy Spirit signified by this that the way into the Holies was not yet thrown open while the first tabernacle was still standing. This first tabernacle is a figure of the present time, inasmuch as gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the worshipper in conscience, since they refer only to food and drink and various ablutions and bodily regulations imposed until a time of reformation. But when Christ appeared once for all through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made by hands - that is, not of this creation, - nor again by virtue of blood of goats and calves, but by virtue of His own Blood, into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption.

!Ps 116:1-2
Praise the Lord, all you nations; glorify Him, all you peoples!
V. For steadfast is His kindness toward us, and the fidelity of the Lord endures forever.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to
!Luke 13:6-17
 At that time, Jesus spoke to the multitudes this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none. And he said to the vine-dresser, ‘Behold, for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down, therefore; why does it still encumber the ground?’ But he answered him and said, ‘Sir, let it alone this year too, till I dig around it and manure it. Perhaps it may bear fruit; but if not, then afterwards you shall cut it down.’ Now He was teaching in one of their synagogues on the Sabbath. And behold, there was a woman who for eighteen years had had a sickness caused by a spirit; and she was bent over and utterly unable to look upwards. When Jesus saw her, He called her to Him and said to her, Woman, you are delivered from your infirmity. And He laid His hands upon her, and instantly she was made straight, and glorified God. But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant that Jesus had cured on the Sabbath, addressed the crowd, saying, There are six days in which one ought to work; on these therefore come and be cured, and not on the Sabbath. But the Lord answered him and said, Hypocrites! does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or ass from the manger, and lead it forth to water? And this woman, daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan has bound, lo, for eighteen years, ought not she to be loosed form this bond on the Sabbath? And as He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and the entire crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by Him.
